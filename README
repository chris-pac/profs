README

1.) Overview

prof is a profiling and analysis tool that gathers relevant data from open-source profiling 
programs to help users understand the behavior of their applications. 
prof produces two files and a directory. 

<target-name>.html 		==> contains summary information and interactive charts
<target-name>.results		==> contains flat summary information
<target-name> directory		==> contains files that were produced while running prof

2.) Requirements

prof has been successfully tested on the following system:

		- Linux/x86_64

prof requires that the following programs be installed and included in the PATH:
				tested with these versions
		- valgrind	[valgrind-3.8.1]
		- pin		[pin-2.14-67254-gcc.4.4.7-linux]
		- gprof		[GNU gprof version 2.20.51.0.2-5.42.el6 20100205]

PIN_ROOT environment variable needs to be set to point to the location of Pin kit directory.

3.) How to build prof

prof is a scrip and does not require building

Our ThreadTimes Pin tool however, does require building:
	copy: ThreadTimes.cpp and the makefile.rules into $PIN_ROOT/source/tools/MyPinTool/ directory
	run: make

4.) How to run prof

./prof <target-name> <binary-pg> <binary(-g)> <program-args>


Please, perform the following actions to run prof tool:
	1. compile source code using the -g option
	2. compile source code using the -pg options
	3. set PIN_ROOT and export PIN_ROOT

5.) Examples and Explanation

In our analysis we use three main programs: gprof, valgind, pin. Please make sure these programs are 
installed before ruining our analysis tool.

We provide a batch script, called prof-run, that runs our profiling and analysis script prof. 
prof-run is an example of what environment variables need to be set and what the input to the prof script looks like. 
In order to make prof-run run successfully please modify all necessary variables and install and 
compile any desired PARSEC programs with -g and -pg options.

In order to build the ThreadTimes pin tool please copy the source file, ThreadTimes.cpp, and the makefile.rules 
into source/tools/MyPinTool/ directory, situated in main Pin kit directory, and run make.
 
Our main script prof takes as input target name, path to binary built with -pg, path to binary 
(should be built with -g in order to extract additional information) and all command arguments necessary to run the binaries. 

The scrip produces flat summary file, interactive chart and summary file, and a directory with files containing detailed output while running prof.
